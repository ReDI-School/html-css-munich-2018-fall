# ReDI School – HTML & CSS Intro

#### ✅ How does this work?
Follow this document from top to bottom. <br>
It's like a checklist to help you setting everything you need for the class. <br>
It is not just for the `First day`, so don't worry if we are not going to complete this in one shot 😄
<br><br>

#### 💁‍ It's very easy
Try to do it on your own – it will help you getting more familiar with the tools we will use.
<br><br>

#### 👀 Where you can look for answer
Whenever there is a problem to solve and you (or we!) don't know how to solve it, we have a great resource. <br><br>
It's called <a href="https://stackoverflow.com" target="_blank">StackOverflow</a>.<br><br>
There is no shame in not knowing something – just be smart when you learn:<br>
don't copy/paste the solution, **type it yourself** 😉
<br><br>
