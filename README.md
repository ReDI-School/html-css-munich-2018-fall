# ReDI School – HTML & CSS Intro

#### ✅ How does this work?
Follow this document from top to bottom. <br>
It's like a checklist to help you setting everything you need for the class. <br>
It is not just for the `First day`, so don't worry if we are not going to complete this in one shot 😄<br><br>

#### 💁‍ It's very easy
Try to do it on your own – it will help you getting more familiar with the tools we will use. <br><br>

#### 🙋‍ You can always ask for help
Raise your hand if you encounter any obstacle – your teachers are here to assist you at any time!

## Code Editor

> You can write `HTML` & `CSS` even in Word or a simpel Text Editor but a Code Editor gives you lots of help.
> <br> **Visual Studio Code** is a great one. Plus, it's free ⭐️

Let's download it <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download" target="_blank">here</a>.
<br><br><br>

## What is a Terminal?

Material and code for every lesson will be shared amongst us all.<br>
To do it, we creat a GitHub account. GitHub is a place where we can save our code and progress over our work.
<br>
<br>
GitHub works with **git**.<br>
**git** is a tool that lets you share and collaborate with other develpoers. <br><br>
It provides you some commands that you can type in order to do that.<br>
This commands are typed and run in the _Terminal_. <br><br>
Let's give it a try to understand it better.

<br>

## How to use the Terminal

#### 🏠 If you have `Windows` Operating System

First of all, go <a href="https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/tag/v2.18.0.windows.1" target="_blank">here</a> to download a useful _Terminal_ for Windows.<br><br>
Once done, open it.
<br><br><br>

#### 🍎 If you have `Apple` Operating System

In this case, the `Terminal` comes built in with all that is needed.<br>
(To run `git` the System will probably ask you to install some Apple stuff... it's nothing dangerous, so don't worry!)<br><br>
Go to `Finder > Applications > Utilities` and double-click on `Terminal.app`
<br><br><br>

#### 🖥 Let's run our first command

Now comes the fun part (that's how professional programmers do so... get ready!) 🙌
