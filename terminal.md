## What is a Terminal?

Material and code for every lesson will be shared amongst us all.<br>
To do it, we will use a tool called `git`.
<br>
<br>
`git` is a place where we can save our code and progress related to our work. <br><br>
It provides you some commands that you can type in order to do that.<br>
To be able to type and tun those commands, we need something called `Terminal`<br><br>
The best way to understand it is to try it so, let's start üòÑ

<br>

## How to use the Terminal

#### üè† If you have `Windows` Operating System

First of all, go <a href="https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/tag/v2.18.0.windows.1" target="_blank">here</a> to download a useful _Terminal_ for Windows.<br><br>
Once done, open it.
<br><br><br>

#### üçé If you have `Apple` Operating System

In this case, the `Terminal` comes built in with all that is needed.<br>
(To run `git` the System will probably ask you to install some Apple stuff... it's nothing dangerous, so don't worry!)<br><br>
Go to `Finder > Applications > Utilities` and double-click on `Terminal.app`
<br><br><br>

#### üñ• Let's run our first command

Now comes the fun part (that's how professional programmers do so... get ready!) üôå

Let's make sure we are on the right place (which in PC is called _folder_).
<br><br>

When you want to wp some code with the `git` tool we mentioned, you need a link, for example
<br><br>
`https://github.com/ReDI-School/html-css-munich-2018-fall.git`
<br><br>

Then, go to the `Terminal` and type
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ReDI-School/html-css-munich-2018-fall.git
```

This command will create a new _folder_  in yout computer: `html-css-munich-2018-fall` and copy some files to it.<br>
It will contain the code that the teachers wanted to share with you.
<br>

If you want to see that code, just go to the new created _folder_, by typing:
```bash
cd html-css-munich-2018-fall
```

From yere, we can start by opening the created project / folder with `VSCode`. <br>
If you don't rememebr how to do it, just go [here](code-editor.md).
